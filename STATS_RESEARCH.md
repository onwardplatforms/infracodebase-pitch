---

## Theme 2: Cloud Misconfigurations & Security

These stats tie trust to real security consequences.

### Gartner Prediction
- **99%** of cloud security failures through 2025 will be the customer's fault
- Primary cause: misconfigurations
- Originally predicted 95% by 2020, updated to 99% by 2025

## Theme 3: Cloud Spend & Waste

Shows the cost of the current broken approach - with concrete dollar figures.

### Dollar Figures (2025)
- **$44.5 billion** in infrastructure cloud waste projected for 2025
- Based on 21% of $211.8B cloud infrastructure spend being wasted
- **$187 billion** wasted annually across all cloud spend (32% of total)
- **$723 billion** total public cloud spending in 2025 (Gartner baseline)
- Source: [Harness FinOps Report](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/44-5-billion-in-infrastructure-cloud-waste-projected-for-2025-due-to-finops-and-developer-disconnect-finds-finops-in-focus-report-from-harness-302385580.html)

### Breach Costs
- **$4.88 million** average cost of a data breach in 2024 (IBM) - highest ever, 10% increase YoY
- **$4.75 million** average for cloud misconfiguration-related breaches
- **$10.22 million** average for US companies specifically

**Potential stat cards:**
| Stat | Label | Source | Why |
|------|-------|--------|-----|
| $44.5B | wasted on cloud infrastructure | Harness 2025 | Concrete dollar figure |
| $4.88M | average breach cost | IBM 2024 | Shows consequence |
| 27% | of cloud spend wasted | Flexera 2025 | Percentage version |
| 84% | struggle to manage spend | Flexera 2025 | Prevalence |

---

## Theme 3B: People Cost & Velocity Waste (NEW)

This is the real cost - human capital wasted on toil, rework, and slow processes.

### Developer Time on Toil/Infrastructure
- **20-60%** of developer time spent on infrastructure management (1-3 days/week)
- **30%** of engineers spend a third of their week on repetitive infrastructure tasks
- **50%** of SRE time on ops work vs actual development
- **60%+** say security/compliance is #1 challenge - still handled manually
- Source: [Harness State of Developer Experience 2024](https://www.devopsdigest.com/toil-takes-its-toll-developer-burnout-is-straining-organizational-resources)

### Productivity Gains Possible
- **37% productivity boost** by eliminating toil
- Equivalent to **740,000 work hours/year** reclaimed per 1,000 developers
- Source: Harness 2024 Report

### Shift-Left Cost Savings
- **$80 to fix in development** vs **$7,600 to fix in production** (IBM)
- That's a **95x cost difference**
- Up to **100x cheaper** with early detection
- Source: [IBM via Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/shift-left-security)

### Rework Costs
- **40-70%** of project budget can go to rework
- **30-50%** of rework costs preventable with early feedback
- Source: Industry studies

### Platform Team Costs (for context)
- **$130-150K/year** average cloud engineer salary (US)
- **3-12 FTEs** needed to maintain an internal developer platform
- **$2M+** and 12+ months to build a custom IDP
- Source: [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Cloud-Engineer-Salary), industry reports

### Simple Math for Investors

**Per-team waste:**
> 10-person platform team × $150K avg = $1.5M/year
> 30% time on toil = **$450K/year wasted** per team

**At enterprise scale:**
> 1,000 engineers × 30% toil × $150K = **$45M/year** in people cost waste

**Potential stat cards:**
| Stat | Label | Source | Why |
|------|-------|--------|-----|
| 30% | of engineer time is toil | Harness 2024 | Relatable to buyers |
| 95x | cheaper to fix early | IBM | Shift-left value prop |
| 37% | productivity boost possible | Harness 2024 | The opportunity |
| $45M | wasted at 1,000 engineers | Calculation | Enterprise-scale impact |

---

## Theme 4: Project Timelines

Need more research here. Current findings are general, not cloud-specific.

### General Findings
- Cloud migrations vary from weeks (simple) to **several months** (complex enterprise)
- **61%** of cloud migrations exceed timelines by 40-100% (Accenture - need to verify source)
- Enterprise-wide cloud adoption takes **12-24 months** (industry consensus)

### HashiCorp State of Cloud Strategy 2024
- Only **8%** of organizations qualify as "highly mature" in cloud operations
- Source: [HashiCorp 2024](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/state-of-the-cloud)

**Gap:** We don't have a single authoritative source stating "cloud projects take X months on average." The user wants to say **3-12 months for typical projects**. Need to find a source or frame it as industry experience.

**Potential stat cards:**
| Stat | Label | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| 8% | are cloud-mature | HashiCorp 2024 |
| 61% | exceed timelines | Accenture (need verification) |

---

## Theme 5: AI Investment ROI

Shows the gap between AI hype and reality.

### Gartner 2025
- **72%** of CIOs report breaking even or losing money on AI investments
- Source: [Gartner Survey](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-20-gartner-survey-finds-all-it-work-will-involve-ai-by-2030)

## Theme 6: AI Project Failure Rates

These stats support the narrative: "Companies try to build this internally, fail, then buy."

### MIT State of AI in Business 2025
- **95%** of generative AI pilots fail to deliver measurable impact on P&L
- Despite **$30-40 billion** in enterprise AI investment
- Only **5%** of AI initiatives producing measurable returns
- Source: [MIT GenAI Divide Report](https://complexdiscovery.com/why-95-of-corporate-ai-projects-fail-lessons-from-mits-2025-study/)

### RAND Corporation (2024)
- **80%** of AI projects fail (twice the rate of traditional IT projects)
- Source: [RAND Corporation](https://blog.quest.com/the-hidden-ai-tax-why-theres-an-80-ai-project-failure-rate/)

### Gartner (2024-2025)
- **30%** of generative AI projects will be abandoned after POC by end of 2025
- **40%+** of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027
- Only **48%** of AI projects make it to production
- Takes **8 months** average from AI prototype to production
- Source: [Gartner Press Release](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-29-gartner-predicts-30-percent-of-generative-ai-projects-will-be-abandoned-after-proof-of-concept-by-end-of-2025)

### S&P Global (2025)
- **42%** of companies abandoned most AI initiatives in 2025 (up from 17% in 2024)
- Average organization scrapped **46%** of AI POCs before production
- Survey of 1,000+ enterprises across North America and Europe
- Source: [S&P Global Market Intelligence](https://medium.com/@stahl950/the-ai-implementation-paradox-why-42-of-enterprise-projects-fail-despite-record-adoption-107a62c6784a)

**Potential narrative:** "Companies try to solve this internally. 80-95% fail. Then they buy."

---

## Theme 7: Build vs Buy Shift

This shows the market is moving toward buying solutions like Infracodebase.

### Menlo Ventures (2025)
- **76%** of enterprise AI use cases are now purchased (vs built internally)
- Complete reversal from 2024 when it was 47% built / 53% purchased
- Source: [Beam AI](https://beam.ai/agentic-insights/the-great-ai-flip-why-76-of-enterprises-stopped-building-ai-in-house)

### Vendor vs Internal Success Rates
- Vendor solutions succeed **67%** of the time
- Internal builds succeed only **33%** of the time
- MIT data: internal builds fail **2x as often** as vendor partnerships
- Source: [ProPair](https://www.propair.ai/insights/build-vs-buy-ai-why-85-of-internal-projects-fail-in-financial-services/)

### Total Cost of Ownership Reality
- What looks like £200K build vs £500K vendor becomes £800K build vs £600K vendor over 3 years
- **60%** of AI development time consumed by integration complexity
- **28%** of internal projects plagued by budget overruns
- Source: [WeBuild-AI](https://www.webuild-ai.com/insights/three-build-vs-buy-mistakes-that-derail-ai-roadmaps-and-how-to-avoid-them)

**Key quote:** "It's common for a company to spend $2-3 million and 2+ years trying to develop a solution in-house that could have been done by a vendor at 10x lower cost."

---

## Theme 8: AI Tool Adoption Gaps (Non-Developers)

This supports the differentiation: AI coding tools are built for developers, not cloud teams.

### The Problem
- AI coding tools (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) run in developer environments
- Cloud teams include non-developers: security engineers, cloud architects, platform engineers
- This creates friction: developers in code tools, everyone else in other systems
- **60%** of organizations lack clear metrics to measure AI's impact
- Only **60%** of organizations have an acceptable AI usage policy

### Platform Engineering Reality
- Teams "install Backstage or spin up Kubernetes clusters expecting transformation, only to face low adoption and frustrated developers"
- "Infrastructure teams, platform engineers, and cloud architects are equally unprepared for the operational complexity of AI agent systems"
- Source: [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/can-platform-engineering-accelerate-ai-adoption/)

### The Solution Direction
- "Utilizing a platform engineering approach to AI adoption provides a single point of access for all tools"
- "An internal developer platform was pinpointed as the best foundation upon which to build AI adoption and add the guardrails and gates necessary"
- Source: [Platform Engineering](https://platformengineering.org/blog/platform-engineering-tools-2026)

**Key insight:** This is exactly what Infracodebase does - provides a platform approach that brings together developers, security, and cloud architects.

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Timeline stat**: Do we have customer/industry data to support "3-12 months for typical cloud projects"? Or should we cite our own experience?

2. **Trust vs Security**: Should we lead with the trust stat (96% don't trust) or the security consequence (45% has vulnerabilities)?

3. **Gartner 99%**: This is a prediction, not a measured stat. Is it too old/overused?

4. **Sonar vs Stack Overflow**: Sonar's 96% is more dramatic but from a company selling code quality tools. Stack Overflow's 46% distrust is from a more neutral source.

5. **Where to use failure stats**: The 95% AI project failure rate - does this go in Problem section or Why Customers Will Pay section?

6. **Build vs Buy narrative**: Should we explicitly call out "they try to build, fail, then buy" in the pitch?

---

## Narrative Options for Problem Section

### Narrative A: Trust-First
"Everyone wants speed. Trust is the limiting factor."
- 96% don't trust AI code (Sonar)
- 45% of AI code has vulnerabilities (Veracode)
- 66% of cloud breaches from misconfig (IBM)
- 27% of cloud spend wasted (Flexera)

### Narrative B: Security-Consequence

- 3-12 months typical project (industry)
- 96% don't trust AI code (Sonar)
- 80% of AI projects fail (RAND)
- 27% of cloud spend wasted (Flexera)

---

## Theme 9: The Trust Gap (NEW - Better Trust Stats)

These are more nuanced trust stats that tie to organizational capability, not just sentiment.

### The 37-Point Trust Gap (DORA + Stack Overflow)
- **DORA 2025**: 70% of respondents express confidence in AI-generated output quality
- **Stack Overflow 2025**: Only 33% of developers trust AI tools
- **The gap**: 37 points - explained by organizational capabilities, not AI quality
- **Key insight**: "Successful AI adoption is a systems problem, not a tools problem"
- Source: [CIO - The 37-Point Trust Gap](https://www.cio.com/article/4114598/the-37-point-trust-gap-its-not-the-ai-its-your-organization.html)

### Gartner AI Maturity Survey (Q4 2024)
- **57%** of high-maturity orgs trust and are ready to use AI solutions
- **14%** of low-maturity orgs trust and are ready to use AI solutions
- **4x trust gap** between mature and immature organizations
- "Trust is one of the differentiators between success and failure for an AI or GenAI initiative"
- Survey of 432 respondents across US, UK, France, Germany, India, Japan
- Source: [Gartner Press Release](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-30-gartner-survey-finds-forty-five-percent-of-organizations-with-high-artificial-intelligence-maturity-keep-artificial-intelligence-projects-operational-for-at-least-three-years)

### Trust is Declining Year-Over-Year (Stack Overflow)
- **2024**: 43% trusted AI accuracy
- **2025**: 33% trust AI accuracy
- **10-point drop** in one year
- More developers actively distrust (46%) than trust (33%)
- Experienced developers most cautious: only 2.6% "highly trust"
- Source: [Stack Overflow 2025 Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai/)

### Only 37% Would Trust AI Autonomously
- Only **37%** of developers would trust AI to handle daily work tasks without human review
- **73%** have experienced problems with "vibecoding" (AI code without understanding)
- Source: [Dev.to Survey](https://dev.to/dev_tips/dev-world-unplugged-65000-developers-survey-results-on-code-ai-and-burnout-in-2024-and-why-3nde)

**Why these are better:**
- The Gartner 57% vs 14% stat directly supports Infracodebase's thesis: the platform provides the maturity that enables trust
- The 37-point gap shows it's a systems problem (what we solve), not an AI problem
- Trust declining YoY shows urgency

---

## Theme 10: Urgency Stats (Why Now)

These show the problem is accelerating, not stabilizing.

### Cloud Security Incidents Increasing
- **154%** increase in cloud security incidents in 2024
- **89%** of organizations report year-over-year increase in incidents
- **Average of 9** cloud security incidents per organization in 2024
- **75%** increase in cloud environment breaches 2022-2023
- **47%** jump in cyberattacks week-over-week
- **27%** of orgs using public cloud faced incidents in 2024 (up 10% from prior year)
- **83%** of organizations dealt with at least one cloud security incident in 2024
- Source: [IDC via Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/11/06/new-idc-research-highlights-a-major-cloud-security-shift/)

### AI Adoption is Accelerating Faster Than Trust
- GenAI adoption **doubled**: 33% (2023) → 65% (2024) → **72-78%** (2025)
- AI spending grew **3.2x** YoY ($11.5B → $37B)
- **78%** of orgs now use AI in at least one business function (McKinsey 2025)
- **72%** specifically use generative AI in at least one function (McKinsey 2025)
- **87%** of large enterprises implementing AI solutions
- **84%** of developers use or plan to use AI tools (up from 76%)
- Source: [McKinsey State of AI 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), [Menlo Ventures 2025](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/)

### Cloud/Infrastructure-Specific AI Adoption (2025)
- **54%** of I&O leaders adopting AI to cut costs (Gartner 2025)
- **50%** cite lack of budget as top AI adoption challenge
- **48%** cite integration difficulties as top challenge
- Executive confidence in AI execution jumped from **53% to 71%** in one year
- **70-85%** of AI initiatives fail due to fragmented data infrastructure
- AI infrastructure spending up **166%** YoY (IDC Q2 2025)
- **84.1%** of AI spending deployed in cloud/shared environments
- Source: [Gartner I&O Survey 2025](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-29-gartner-survey-54-percent-of-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders-are-adopting-artificial-intelligence-to-cut-costs), [Flexential 2025](https://www.flexential.com/resources/report/2025-state-ai-infrastructure)

**The collision course:**
- AI adoption: ↑↑↑ (doubling, tripling)
- Trust in AI: ↓ (declining 10 points YoY)
- Security incidents: ↑↑↑ (154% increase)
- Misconfigurations: Still #1 cause of breaches

This is the "Why Now" story: Adoption is outpacing trust. Incidents are increasing. Something has to give.
